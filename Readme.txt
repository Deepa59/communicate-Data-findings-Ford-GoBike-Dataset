Analysis of Ford_Go_Bike System

Dataset
The data consist of approximately 1,85M bike rides from FY2018. The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type, gender, and birth date. 155K data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies in the birth date, which in some cases was dated prior 1900. The data can be found here, with feature documentation available here.

Summary of Findings:
In the exploration, I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around the lunch time, and customers, usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area. The bike share system was used more often around summertime (May-October) with a clear drop from January to March, most probably due to the weather condition. Moreover, I have checked if there are some differences in trends for genders and different age groups. In most cases the trend for males/females was the same, except for the fact that females tend to have slightly longer trips and suprisingly, for casual users there are quite a lot of females using the system between January and March in comparison to males (the ratio is much smaller than for the rest of the year).With respect to age groups, 55yrs and above users make long duration trips when compared to users of 25-40yrs, who make short trips mostly representing school going/working crowd and the former could be representing  retired officials.

Key Insights for Presentation:
For the presentation, I focus certain key attributes of Bike users influencing the trips and duration of the trips. , 1.I start by exploring the maximum #bike trips for rental time.(weekly,hourly,),2.Next thing is to find percentage of users based on gender and 3.with respect to subscription type i.e, those who use the system occasionally and those who has a membership(donut and pie charts are used respectively).4.Further exploring subscription type vs Gender. 5.Moving on to finding length of trip duration for every Usertype –violin plots are used for the same.  6.Analysing weekday trends per Usertype.7.trip duration for age groups in addition to usertype and gender. 8. Lastly, I move to daily and weekly habits of customers. I use the heatmap to show when bikes are high in demand throughout the week to futher show the difference in renting behaviour.
